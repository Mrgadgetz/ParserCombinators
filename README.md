Parser Combinators
==================
Parser combintors are higher order functions which receives patterns as input and returns a new parser as it output.

I'm writting this small library for the sake of learning how parser combinators and monads (or computational expresions in F#) work.

I'm using the same names for functions and operators as in [FParsec](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/) which is a parser combinator library for F#, which is an adaptation of [Parsec](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec) Haskell library.
